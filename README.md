SONG OF DEATH, THE GAME
Characters
1.	Charles the ship- It’s a spaceship with guns and some special powers attached to it. Can move in all direction/orientation. It is the ship on which the gamer will have the controls.
2.	Bomber the hunter- he is the main villain of the game, it’s basically want to hunt down our Charles. And will have power twice than the ship.
3.	Shooter… Sharp-shooter- It’s an insult to the villain if he doesn’t have followers. But not in our case bomber got some help from our large group of sharpshooters, with some super powers.
4.	Needle the pincher- They’re the blind followers of Bomber the hunter. With a special power of infinite pinching gun shots.
Now we are all set and got familiar with the characters? Maybe, but we can at-least expect to see them in the journey surely.
